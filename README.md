Autocompletion for the xbps package manager
-----------------------

### Installation
Add these to your .bashrc
```
source /path/to/xbps-install-completion
source /path/to/xbps-remove-completion
```

### TODO
- [ ] Improve Speed (calling xbps-query everytime isn't the best)
- [ ] Combine both completion files into one?
